This project outlines a comprehensive techno-economical process design methodology for the separation of Tetrahydrofuran (THF) from water using various entrainers, focusing on Extractive Distillation (ED) at its core through Aspen Plus simulation and economic analysis. The selection of entrainers, such as ethylene glycol, glycerol, and DMSO, is crucial for economic feasibility and environmental impact.
